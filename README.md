# Real-Time Healthcare Alerts Pipeline

This project simulates a real-time healthcare data pipeline using Apache Kafka, PySpark, and Python to detect clinical anomalies from patient data.

Ingest mock HL7/FHIR patient data, process it in real-time, and generate alerts for abnormal conditions (e.g., high heart rate, low oxygen level). Built for showcasing real-time streaming and alerting systems.

- **Apache Kafka** â€“ for real-time data ingestion
- **PySpark** â€“ for transformation and rule processing
- **Python** â€“ for orchestration and alerts
- **(Simulated) Snowflake** â€“ mock final load target (optional)
